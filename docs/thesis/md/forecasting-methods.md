# Conventional Methods

## Exponential Smoothing

> - Exponential smoothing was proposed in the late 1950s (Brown, [1959](https://otexts.com/fpp2/expsmooth.html#ref-Brown59); Holt, [1957](https://otexts.com/fpp2/expsmooth.html#ref-Holt57); Winters, [1960](https://otexts.com/fpp2/expsmooth.html#ref-Winters60)), and has motivated some of the most successful forecasting methods.

> - Forecasts produced using exponential smoothing methods are *weighted  averages of past observations, with the weights decaying exponentially  as the observations get older*. In other words, *the more recent the  observation the higher the associated weight.* [[hyndman20XXprinciples](https://otexts.com/fpp2/expsmooth.html)]

# Machine Learning Methods

## RNNs

(... )  deep learning models (...) designed specifically for processing *sequential data*, and thus could be applied for time series. [[smirnov20XXtsc]](https://project.inria.fr/aaldt18/files/2018/08/oral.pdf)
