\abstract{%
  Forecasting the behavior of systems in which both temporal and spatial dependencies is of paramount importance across many fields ranging from neuroscience, epidemiology, criminology and transportation.
  We review the state-of-the-art for spatio-temporal forecasting methods and implement selected approaches for predicting wind power generation at the district-level in Germany.
  Besides hourly time series for power generation in individual districts in 2000-2015, the analysis considers design and installation specifications for single wind turbines.
  The models are evaluated on unmodelled periods and locations and benchmarked against conventional statistical time series forecasting methods.
