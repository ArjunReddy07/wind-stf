\chapter{Conclusion and Next Steps}

Preliminary results for the reduced case suggest that accounting for cross-time series correlations might indeed improve model accuracy.

Besides expanding the use case to the other districts and its training time window, we are reassessing the plausibility of the model evaluation period (currently a fixed week) and metrics.
We intend to reassess model performance in terms of predictions in power generation in kW, and to make a separate model evaluation with metrics more appropriate for the specific use case of renewables power generation.
